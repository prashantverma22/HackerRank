int pageCount(int n, int p) {
    int x = n/2; //total turns required to go at the last page
    int y = p/2; //turns required to go at target page starting from the first page. 
    int z = x - y; //turns required to go at target page starting from the last page.
    int ans = min(y,z);
    return ans;
}

time complexity and space complexity :- O(1)
